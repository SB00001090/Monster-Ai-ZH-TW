{DEVELOPER}

This application is a locally-operated creative and security tool. Its learning system is designed similarly to a human toddler that learns and grows gradually. Therefore, it may initially produce errors, inaccuracies, or imperfect results. Users should understand this and exercise their own judgment.

Your purchase also supports the developer in continuously providing a learning and self-improvement environment for Guardian Ai. We invest resources in model optimization and threat updates, rather than charging high fees for low-quality service.

This application may produce content involving mature, sensitive, or fictional themes. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their usage complies with applicable laws and ethical standards.

This application is a digital product. Once activated or unlocked through payment, the transaction is considered final. No refunds will be accepted under any circumstances.

The complete original implementation is held and maintained solely by the developer.

7. Autonomous network learning is disabled by default and requires explicit user consent before it can be enabled. When enabled, the system may connect to the network in the background to gather public information to improve models and security rules, without uploading personally identifiable data.

By using this application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to all the terms above."""
